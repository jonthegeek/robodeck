Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to *edit* a deck than to *create* one from
scratch. Enter robodeck!

This extremely experimental package uses the [OpenAI
API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/) to generate Quarto
slide decks quickly.

## Installation

You can install the development version of robodeck from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jonthegeek/robodeck")
```

## Usage

We do not recommend using the output of this package without editing.
That said, the deck below was generated without editing, as an example.

``` r
library(robodeck)
description <- 
  "robodeck is an R package that utilizes the OpenAI API 
   (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/) to quickly generate Quarto 
   slide decks. In this lightning talk I will demonstrate how to use 
   robodeck::gen_deck() to automatically generate a slide deck from just a title 
   and description, and why you should carefully edit the results!" |> 
  stringr::str_squish()

# Store an API key in an environment variable called OPENAI_API_KEY.

deck_markdown <- gen_deck(
  title = "Introducing robodeck",
  description = description,
  minutes = 5
)
```

Note that function calls will hit the OpenAI API, which is not free. At
the time of this writing, experiments with the API while writing this
package have incurred a total cost of about \$0.13, almost all of that
while experimenting with the more expensive ‚ÄúGPT-4-turbo‚Äù API. By
default, robodeck uses the ‚ÄúGPT-3.5-turbo‚Äù API, which should cost
\<\$0.01 to generate a deck.
