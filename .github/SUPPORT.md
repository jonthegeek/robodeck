# Getting help with robodeck

Thanks for using robodeck!
Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat! 
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). 
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

## Where to ask?

Armed with your reprex, the next step is to figure out where to ask. 

*   If it's a question: It's best to ask on the [R4DS Online Learning Community Slack](https://r4ds.io/join). Other options include [Posit Community](https://community.rstudio.com/), and StackOverflow. There are more people there to answer questions.

*   If it's a bug: you're in the right place, [file an issue](https://github.com/jonthegeek/robodeck/issues/new).  
  
*   If you're not sure: let the community help you figure it out! 
    If your problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and report it. 

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/jonthegeek/robodeck/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

## What happens next?

We'll try to look at your issue as soon as we can, but these packages are maintained by volunteers.
A good reprex is particularly important because it might be weeks or months between your initial report and when we start working on it. 
If we can’t reproduce the bug, we can’t fix it!
